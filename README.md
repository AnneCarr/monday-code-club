# monday-code-club
For Monday code club jupyter notebooks

For the first notebook, the file used was downloaded from https://data.gov.uk/dataset/numbers_of_patients_registered_at_a_gp_practice/resource/b42603dd-ab68-4ca2-9596-19a8f4455604
and saved in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook with the file name in the notebook (I think it was gp_data.csv).
